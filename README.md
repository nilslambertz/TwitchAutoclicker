# TwitchAutoclicker
Small Chrome-Extension for auto-clicking links in twitch-chat-messages.

## Features
**username**, **website** can be set and **autoclick** can be enabled.

If **autoclick** is enabled, every chat-message from **username** will be searched for links, if the URL contains **website**, the link will be clicked.

You can use a full URL as **website** or just part of the url, like *twitch.tv* or just *twitch*.
